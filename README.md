### Task 1.Project Board Walkthrough

**Objective:**
 To our strategic approach to task delegation, milestone tracking, and the continuous delivery of project goals. By showcasing our project management framework, we emphasize the structured workflow and proactive problem-solving that ensures successful project outcomes.

### Task Assignments:
1.	Task Mapping 
•	Guideline: Ensure all work done has a task it can be mapped to. 
•	Assigned Task: Review current project board to verify that each task correlates to a project deliverable. 
•	Responsible:
2.	Task Breakdown 
•	Guideline: Most tasks should be less than 4 hours of work. If longer, they should be broken down. 
•	Assigned Task: Audit larger tasks and split them into smaller, actionable units. 
•	Responsible:
3.	Task Assignment for “In-Progress” and “Done” 
•	Guideline: Ensure all “in-progress” and “done” tasks are assigned, and most “to-do” tasks have an assignee. 
•	Task: Review and assign all unassigned tasks in the “In-Progress” and “Done” columns. Responsible:
4.	Individual Task Ownership 
•	Guideline: Assign most tasks to a single individual rather than multiple team members.
•	Assigned Task: Re-assign tasks with multiple assignees to one responsible individual while maintaining collaboration. 
•	Responsible:
5.	Swimlane Organization 
•	Guideline: Maintain at least three swimlanes: To Do, In Progress, and Done. 
•	Assigned Task: Verify the existence of swimlanes and ensure tasks are allocated correctly. 
•	Responsible:
